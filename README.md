Create a small zoo using oop concept with java programming.

This is an interactive menu system to work with the objects of the classes. 
The Animal class implements an interface named Eat. The interface has two methods, but it implements only one. Since the Animal class does not implement all the methods of the Eat interface, the child classes will implement the unimplemented methods. and create two interfaces named Walk and Swim and apply the functionality of the methods of the Walk and Swim interfaces in certain classes only.
